# Bambuddy Home Assistant Add-on

## Configuration Options

This add-on provides several configuration options to customize your Bambuddy experience. Most users can leave these at their default values.

### Auto-Slicing Configuration
If you want to use the automated print queuing and slicing features, you must install the accompanying Slicer API add-ons provided in the same repository as Bambuddy:
*   **Slicer API - Orca** (Slug: `bambuddy_orca_slicer_api`)
*   **Slicer API - Bambu** (Slug: `bambuddy_bambu_studio_api`)

Because Bambuddy runs in `host_network` mode, it communicates with these sidecars locally through the host machine rather than the internal Docker bridge network. The default configurations are pre-populated and ready to use without requiring internal DNS names:
*   **`orcaslicer_api_url`**: `http://127.0.0.1:3003`
*   **`bambu_studio_api_url`**: `http://127.0.0.1:3001`
*   **`preferred_slicer`**: Select which slicer engine you want Bambuddy to use by default.

### Security
*   **`mfa_encryption_key`**: A 32-character string used to encrypt the MFA database. Leave blank for default internal security, or define your own for maximum security.

### Database
*   **`database_url`**: By default, Bambuddy creates a local `bambuddy.db` file in your `/share/bambuddy/data` folder. If you are a power user and want to connect to an external PostgreSQL database for high availability, enter the connection string here (e.g., `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@192.168.1.50/bambuddy`). Otherwise, **leave this blank**.

### Virtual Printer Configuration
*   **`virtual_printer_pasv_address`**: Bambuddy can emulate a physical printer to trick Bambu Studio/OrcaSlicer into sending files to it directly. This emulation uses the FTP protocol. Passive FTP (PASV) requires the server to tell the client what IP address to use for the data connection. 
    *   If Bambuddy is running behind complex routing, you may need to explicitly tell it your Home Assistant machine's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) so it hands out the correct IP to your slicer software. 
    *   For most flat local networks, you can **leave this blank**.

### MQTT Relay Settings
Bambuddy connects directly to your printer to monitor it, but it can also "Relay" these events (Print Started, Filament Low, etc.) to your Home Assistant MQTT broker so you can build automations around them.

**If you use the official Mosquitto Add-on, MQTT works automatically with no configuration needed.** The add-on auto-discovers broker credentials from the Supervisor at startup.

All MQTT fields are **blank by default** in the add-on config. You only need to fill them in if you want to override auto-discovered values or use a custom broker:

*   **`mqtt_enabled`**: Leave blank for auto-detection, or set explicitly to `true`/`false`.
*   **`mqtt_broker`**: Auto-detected from Mosquitto if blank. Set to a custom address if using an external broker.
*   **`mqtt_port`**: Typically `1883`. Auto-detected if blank.
*   **`mqtt_username`** / **`mqtt_password`**: Auto-detected from Mosquitto if blank. Set manually for external brokers.
*   **`mqtt_topic_prefix`**: The root topic for events (default in Bambuddy: `bambuddy`).
*   **`mqtt_use_tls`**: Auto-detected if blank. Toggle for brokers requiring secure connections.

> **Note:** Settings configured in the Bambuddy web UI persist across restarts as long as the corresponding add-on config field is left blank. Filling in an add-on config field will override the web UI value on each restart.

### Network Ports (Advanced)
Because Bambuddy relies on emulating physical Bambu Lab printer hardware to capture print jobs via the "Virtual Printer" feature, it must run in `host_network` mode. This means it binds directly to your Home Assistant host's network interfaces.

It uses the following ports internally. **If you have other Add-ons using these ports, Bambuddy's Virtual Printer feature may fail to start:**
*   **8000 (TCP)**: The Bambuddy Web UI.
*   **8883 (TCP)**: MQTT Status Stream (Conflicts with Mosquitto Add-on if TLS is enabled on default port. You may need to change Mosquitto's SSL port to 18883/18884).
*   **3000 & 3002 (TCP)**: Virtual Printer Handshake / Slicer proxy (Conflicts with Z-Wave JS UI. You must change Z-Wave JS UI's host port if installed).
*   **322 & 6000 (TCP)**: RTSP Camera streaming ports.
*   **990 (TCP) & 50000-50100 (TCP)**: FTPS server and dynamic file upload ports. 
*   **2021 (UDP)**: Virtual Printer SSDP / mDNS auto-discovery broadcast.

### Persistent Data & Custom Presets
The Bambuddy add-on uses Home Assistant's `/share` directory to safely store its database and user data so that it persists across reboots and add-on updates.

You can access these files via the **Samba Share** add-on or the **File Editor** add-on at:
*   `/share/bambuddy/data/bambuddy.db` - Your persistent SQLite database containing all print history, stats, and settings.
*   `/share/bambuddy/logs/` - Diagnostic logs.

**Importing Custom Presets:**
To import custom filament or slicing presets into Bambuddy, you do **not** need to manually drop files into the `/share` folder. Simply open the **Bambuddy Web UI**, navigate to the **Presets** or **Library** section, and use the built-in upload/import tools to add your custom `.json` or `.3mf` presets. Because the database is safely mapped to the `/share` folder, your imported profiles will be permanently saved.
